# librrd-rs

Rust programming language bindings for [librrd](https://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/doc/librrd.en.html).

> [!WARNING]  
> Please use [cygnus9/rrd-rust](https://github.com/cygnus9/rrd-rust) crate which has exactly same purpose. This repository is for my own learning purpose. Very much work in progress.
